**Requirements Document: FAQ Recommendations Frontend Application**

**Overview:**

This document outlines the requirements for the frontend development of the FAQ Recommendations application. The goal is to create a simple and modern user interface (UI) that allows users to efficiently search and view FAQs. The frontend will be developed using NextJS and React.

**Technologies:**

* NextJS
* React
* CSS (or a CSS framework/library such as Tailwind CSS or Material UI)
* JavaScript

**Target User:**

* Users of the FAQ Recommendations application seeking answers to their questions.

**Epics (Large Features):**

1.  **Header Display:** The user should be able to view the page header with the application title and social media links.
2.  **FAQ Search:** The user should be able to select an FAQ, enter a question, and perform a search.
3.  **FAQ Display:** The user should be able to view the list of questions and answers for the selected FAQ, with relevance displayed after a search.

**User Stories (Detailed Requirements):**

**Epic 1: Header Display**

* As a user, I want to see the title "FAQ Recommendations" on the left side of the header.
* As a user, I want to see clickable LinkedIn and GitHub icons on the right side of the header.
* As a developer, I want the header to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.

**Epic 2: FAQ Search**

* As a user, I want to be able to select an FAQ from a mandatory dropdown.
* As a user, I want to be able to enter my question in a text field.
* As a user, I want to be able to click a "Search" button to perform the search.
* As a developer, I want the "Search" button to be disabled until an FAQ is selected.
* As a developer, I want the search to be performed by calling the backend API with the selected FAQ and the user's question.

**Epic 3: FAQ Display**

* As a user, I want to see all questions and answers of the selected FAQ displayed on the screen.
* As a user, I want the list of FAQs to be reordered based on the relevance of the question after a search.
* As a user, I want the relevance of each FAQ to be displayed after the search (e.g., with a bar or score).
* As a developer, I want the list of FAQs to be rendered dynamically with data returned from the API.
* As a developer, I want to use subtle animations to indicate the reordering of the list.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* The FAQ selection dropdown must be mandatory and functional.
* The search button must function correctly and call the backend API.
* The list of FAQs must be displayed and reordered correctly after the search.
