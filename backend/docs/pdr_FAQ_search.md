## Agile Requirements Document: FAQ Search

**Overview:**

This document outlines the requirements for the FAQ Search functionality within the backend of the FAQ Recommendations application. The goal is to enable users to quickly find answers to their questions by using semantic search to identify the most relevant FAQs.

**Target User:**

*   Users of the FAQ Recommendations application.

**Epics (Large Features):**

1.  **Search by Question:** As a user, I want to be able to enter a question in natural language and receive a list of relevant FAQs, with the option to restrict the search to a specific FAQ.
2.  **Controllable Number of Results:** As a user, I want to be able to specify the number of FAQs that will be returned in the search.
3.  **Ordering by Relevance:** As a user, I want the search results to be ordered by relevance, with the most relevant FAQs appearing first.

**User Stories (Detailed Requirements):**

**Epic 1: Search by Question**

*   As a user, I want to be able to enter a question in a text field.
*   As a user, I want the search to be performed as soon as I click a "Search" button or press the "Enter" key.
*   As a user, I want to receive a list of FAQs that match my question.
*   As a user, I want the list of FAQs to include the title of the FAQ and a snippet of the answer that is relevant to my question.
*   As a user, I want the search to be tolerant of spelling errors and synonyms.
*   As a user, I want to have the option to select a specific FAQ to restrict the search if I already know which FAQ might contain the answer.
*   As a user, I want the list of FAQs available for selection to be presented in a clear and organized manner.
*   As a user, I want the search to be performed only within the selected FAQ when a specific FAQ is selected.

**Epic 2: Controllable Number of Results**

*   As a user, I want to be able to specify the number of FAQs that will be returned in the search (e.g., 3, 5, 10).
*   As a user, I want the system to have a default value for the number of FAQs returned if I do not specify a value.

**Epic 3: Ordering by Relevance**

*   As a user, I want the search results to be ordered by relevance, based on the semantic similarity between my question and the FAQs.
*   As a user, I want the relevance to be clearly indicated (e.g., with a score or visual indicator).

**Acceptance Criteria (Examples):**

*   **Search by Question:** The search should return relevant results for questions in natural language in less than 2 seconds. When a specific FAQ is selected, the search should return results only from that FAQ.
*   **Controllable Number of Results:** The search should return the specified number of FAQs, or the maximum number available if there are fewer FAQs than the specified number.
*   **Ordering by Relevance:** The search results should be ordered by relevance, with an accuracy of at least 80% (evaluated by a human reviewer).

**Next Steps:**

*   Prioritize the Epics and User Stories based on the value to the user and the development effort.
*   Refine the User Stories with more details during sprint planning.
*   Develop and test the functionalities in iterative sprints.
*   Collect user feedback and adapt the plan as needed.

**Notes:**

This document is a starting point and will be updated throughout development. The prioritization and scope of features may be adjusted based on user feedback and business needs.
